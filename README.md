# perso-gamejam-1D

Game prototype created in one week. Obstacles are invisibles until you hit them !

- Constraints : Only tree inputs to control the player
- Theme : Start from nothing

## Setup and Features

- Created with SFML and OpenGL (pixel perfect display)
- Based on a custom renderer, everything is based on pixel arrays (effects, map walls, player, ...)
- Sytem to easily create map based on simple BMP (including moving obstacles)
